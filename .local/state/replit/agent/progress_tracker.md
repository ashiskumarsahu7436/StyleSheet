  - `/api/spreadsheets/:id` (DELETE) - Delete spreadsheet
  - `/api/spreadsheets` (GET) - List all user's spreadsheets

### ‚úÖ **Cloud Save Feature Implemented**

[x] **Data Saved to Cloud**
  - Complete spreadsheet state saved (all sheets, cell data, formatting, merged cells, column widths, row heights)
  - Data persists in PostgreSQL database
  - Only saved when user clicks Cloud button (no auto-save)
  - Requires user to be signed in

[x] **Authentication-Protected**
  - Cloud save only works when signed in
  - Shows "Sign in required" message if not authenticated
  - Redirects to login page automatically
  - Each user's files are private (isolated by user ID)

### ‚úÖ **All Core Features Complete**
[x] **File Browser UI** - To open saved spreadsheets
  - List all saved spreadsheets for current user

  - Delete option for unwanted files
  - This feature completes the full cloud workflow

### üöÄ **Latest Session (Oct 22, 2025 - Cloud Save/Open/Download Fixes)**

  - Files now save as proper Excel format (.xlsx)
  - Added ExcelJS conversion for save and load operations
  - Backend returns proper MIME type for Excel files
  - File list query updated to search for .xlsx files

[x] **Excel Round-Trip Conversion** - Full formatting preservation
  - Fixed field name mappings (fontWeight, fontStyle, textDecoration, color, backgroundColor)
  - Text decorations: underline, double underline, strikethrough all preserved
  - Combined decorations supported ('underline line-through')
  - Color only saved when explicitly set (no forced defaults)

  - Files download with correct Excel format
  - Filename sanitization improved

[x] **All Issues Resolved** - Cloud workflow fully functional
  - Save: Files save as .xlsx with full formatting
  - Open: Files load correctly with all formatting preserved
  - Download: Files download as proper Excel files
  - Ready for production use

### üöÄ **Previous Session (Oct 22, 2025 - Replit Environment Migration)**
[x] **Package Installation** - Complete
  - Installed all npm dependencies (624 packages)
  - tsx runtime now available
  - All dependencies successfully installed

[x] **Workflow Restart** - Complete
  - Application successfully running on port 5000
  - Express server started without errors
  - Vite dev server connected and running

[x] **Project Verification** - Complete
  - Spreadsheet UI fully loaded and functional
  - All features working perfectly (grid, toolbar, controls, formulas)
  - Sign in with Google button visible (OAuth credentials will need to be configured by user)
  - Cloud save functionality ready (requires Google OAuth setup)
  - Application is ready for development

[x] **Migration Complete** - All tasks finished!
  - Project successfully migrated to Replit environment
  - Ready for user to continue building
  - Import marked as completed

### üöÄ **Deployment Status**
[x] **Render Deployment** - All Issues Fixed!
  - **Issue 1:** Code was using Neon serverless driver but user had Render PostgreSQL
    - Switched from `@neondatabase/serverless` to standard `pg` driver
    - Changed `drizzle-orm/neon-serverless` to `drizzle-orm/node-postgres`
    - Added SSL configuration for production
  - **Issue 2:** Drizzle config had incorrect table filter
    - Had `tablesFilter: ["spreadsheet_app.*"]` which didn't match actual tables
    - Removed the incorrect filter
  - **Issue 3:** Shared database needed proper isolation
    - User is sharing database with another webapp
    - Added PostgreSQL schema namespace: `stylesheet_app`
    - Tables now isolated: `stylesheet_app.users`, `stylesheet_app.sessions`, `stylesheet_app.spreadsheets`
    - No conflicts with other webapp's tables
    - Schema successfully pushed to database
  - **Issue 4:** Render free version has no shell access
    - Cannot manually run database setup commands
    - Created safe setup script that only creates stylesheet_app schema
    - Updated build script to auto-run schema setup on deploy
    - Script won't touch other app's data (safe for shared database)
  - **Ready to deploy!** ‚úÖ

### üìù **How it Works**
1. **Sign In**: Click "Sign In" button (top-right corner of Controls panel)
2. **Create Spreadsheet**: Use the spreadsheet normally
3. **Save to Cloud**: Click cloud icon (‚òÅÔ∏è) in toolbar
4. **Enter Name**: Type unique file name in dialog
5. **Confirm**: Click "Save" to store in cloud
6. **Overwrite**: If name exists, confirm overwrite or choose new name
7. **Success**: Toast notification confirms save

### üîß **Technical Implementation**
- **Frontend**: React with TanStack Query for API calls
- **Backend**: Express.js with Passport.js for OAuth
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon-backed) with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth (OpenID Connect)
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL with connect-pg-simple
- **Security**: HTTP-only cookies, session-based auth, user isolation
