## Current Workflow
1. **Drag Selection**: Creates temporary selection (5 seconds)
2. **Select Button**: Converts temporary → permanent OR toggles existing selection
3. **Lock Button**: Directly converts temporary → permanent AND enables lock mode (or toggles if already permanent)
4. **Apply Changes**: Selection clears after one change (if Lock OFF)
5. **Double-click Header/Grid**: Deselects all cells instantly

## Latest Fixes
✅ Lock button now works directly - no need to click Select first! It automatically converts temporary selections to permanent and enables lock mode in one click.
✅ Selection styling improved - now uses colored border with transparent interior, so cell content and background colors remain visible when selected.
✅ **Font display issue PROPERLY FIXED** - Selection now stays active after changing font/size, so toolbar always shows the current font of selected cells
  - Changed all font formatting handlers to preserve selection instead of clearing it
  - When cells are selected and you change font, selection stays so you can see the current values
  - Temporary selections automatically convert to permanent when formatting is applied
✅ **Double-click selection border removed** - Added select-none CSS to toolbar controls (buttons, labels) while keeping text selection enabled in Input field

## Updated Workflow for Fonts
1. Select cells (drag or click)
2. Change font, size, bold, italic, or underline
3. **Selection stays active** - you can see the current font/size in toolbar
4. Make more formatting changes if needed
5. Click elsewhere to deselect
