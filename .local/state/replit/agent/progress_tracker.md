## Arrow Key Navigation Feature (Oct 12, 2025 - 6:07 PM - CURRENT)
[x] **NEW FEATURE: Excel/Google Sheets-style arrow key navigation**
  - **Requirement**: User can select a cell and use arrow keys to move selection to adjacent cells
  - **Behavior**: 
    - Select any cell → Press Up/Down/Left/Right arrow keys → Selection moves to adjacent cell
    - Works exactly like Excel and Google Sheets
    - Only works when exactly one cell is selected
    - Does not interfere with typing in input fields
  
[x] **Implementation Components**:
  - ✅ **Helper Functions**:
    - `getColumnIndex()`: Converts column labels (A, B, AZ) to numeric indices
    - `parseCellAddress()`: Parses cell addresses like "B5" into {col: 1, row: 4}
    - `navigateCell()`: Main navigation logic that calculates next cell based on direction
  
  - ✅ **Boundary Handling**: Prevents navigation outside grid
    - Up: row = Math.max(0, row - 1) → Cannot go above row 1
    - Down: row = Math.min(99, row + 1) → Cannot go below row 100
    - Left: col = Math.max(0, col - 1) → Cannot go left of column A
    - Right: col = Math.min(51, col + 1) → Cannot go right of column AZ
  
  - ✅ **Keyboard Event Listener**:
    - Document-level keydown listener via useEffect
    - Prevents default scrolling when arrow keys pressed
    - Filters out events when typing in input/textarea fields
    - Only navigates when exactly one cell is selected
    - Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
  
  - ✅ **Integration with Existing Systems**:
    - Uses existing `handleCellSelect()` to move selection
    - Works with existing 5-second auto-deselect timer
    - Works with both selectedCells and temporarySelectedCells states
    - Maintains all existing selection behavior
  
[x] **Verified Working**:
  - ✅ Application hot-reloaded successfully (2 HMR updates)
  - ✅ No LSP errors
  - ✅ Screenshot confirms app running correctly
  - ✅ Architect reviewed and approved all implementation details
  - ✅ All four directions (Up/Down/Left/Right) properly implemented
  - ✅ Boundary checks verified correct for 100×52 grid
  - ✅ Event listener properly integrated without memory leaks
  - ✅ No interference with input fields confirmed

## Selection Behavior Fixes (Oct 12, 2025 - 4:32 PM)
[x] **FIXED: B, I, U, A buttons now show visual selection when clicked without selection**
  - **Issue**: Formatting buttons applied to all cells but didn't show blue selection
  - **Solution**: When no cells selected, all 5,200 cells (100×52) temporarily selected (blue) for 5 seconds
  - **Behavior**: Click B/I/U/A without selection → all cells turn blue → disappear after 5 seconds
  - **Applies to**: Bold, Italic, Underline, and Color buttons
  
[x] **FIXED: Manual cell clicks now have 5-second auto-deselect timer**
  - **Issue**: Drag selections disappeared after 5 seconds ✓, but manual clicks stayed selected forever ✗
  - **Solution**: Changed handleCellSelect to use temporarySelectedCells with 5-second timer
  - **Behavior**: Click cell → selected (blue) for 5 seconds → auto-deselects
  - **Matches**: Drag selection behavior (consistent UX)
  
[x] **FIXED: Row/column header selection now has 5-second auto-deselect timer**
  - **Issue**: Double-clicking row/column headers created permanent selections (never expired)
  - **Solution**: Changed handleRowSelect and handleColumnSelect to use temporarySelectedCells with 5-second timer
  - **Behavior**: 
    - Double-click row header → entire row (52 cells) selected for 5 seconds → auto-deselects
    - Double-click column header → entire column (100 cells) selected for 5 seconds → auto-deselects
  - **Consistency**: All selection methods now use same 5-second timer system
  
[x] **FIXED: Click outside grid now uses single-click (not double-click)**
  - **Issue**: Had to double-click to clear selection
  - **Solution**: Changed onDoubleClick to onClick
  - **Behavior**: Single click anywhere outside grid → selection clears immediately
  
[x] **Implementation Details**:
  - ✅ handleCellSelect clears selectedCells, sets temporarySelectedCells to single cell, starts 5-second timer
  - ✅ handleDragSelection clears selectedCells, sets temporarySelectedCells to range, starts 5-second timer
  - ✅ handleRowSelect clears selectedCells, sets temporarySelectedCells to row cells (52 cells), starts 5-second timer
  - ✅ handleColumnSelect clears selectedCells, sets temporarySelectedCells to column cells (100 cells), starts 5-second timer
  - ✅ All formatting handlers (B/I/U/color) show all cells selected when no selection exists
  - ✅ onClick handler on grid container clears both selection states
  - ✅ Proper timer cleanup prevents memory leaks
  - ✅ All selection entry points converge on temporarySelectedCells with identical timer pattern
  
[x] **Verified Working**:
  - ✅ Application hot-reloaded successfully
  - ✅ No LSP errors
  - ✅ Screenshot confirms app running correctly
  - ✅ Architect confirmed all fixes working correctly
  - ✅ All four selection types (cell, drag, row, column) now consistent with 5-second timer

## Auto Adjust Height Fix (Oct 18, 2025 - 6:02 PM - UPDATED 6:26 PM)
[x] **FIXED: Last line text being cut off in Auto Adjust function**
  - **Problem**: Text in wrapped cells was being cut off at the bottom (last line partially hidden)
    - Example: "123456789012345678990" - the last "0" was being cut off after Auto Adjust
  - **Root cause 1**: Height calculation was treating font size in points (pt) as pixels (px)
  - **Root cause 2**: Edge case when text wraps exactly at column boundary (150-160px flexible limit)
    - When column is capped at 150px and last character wraps, insufficient padding caused cutoff
  - **Solution implemented:**
    - ✅ Proper pt to px conversion: 1pt = 4/3 px (1.333px)
    - ✅ Accurate line height calculation in pixels: fontSizePx * 1.4
    - ✅ **Increased padding from 4px → 6px → 10px** (final) to prevent text cutoff in edge cases
    - ✅ Account for textarea height offset (cellHeight - 2px)
  - **Technical details:**
    - Modified `calculateRequiredHeight()` function in home.tsx
    - Convert fontSize from pt to px before calculating line height
    - Calculate: `requiredHeight = Math.ceil(totalLines * lineHeightPx) + 10`
    - 10px padding handles edge cases where text wraps exactly at column width boundary
  - **Flexible width limit (150-160px):**
    - If text width is 150-160px: column extends to prevent word break
    - If text width > 160px: column capped at 150px, text wraps with proper height calculation
  - **Result**: All text lines now fully visible after Auto Adjust - no more cutting! ✅
