## Summary
✅ All packages installed successfully (478 packages)
✅ Workflow "Start application" is running on port 5000
✅ Application verified and working - StyleSheet (Excel-like Builder) app is fully functional
✅ Select button bug fixed and verified

## Merge Cells Button - Google Sheets Style (Oct 12, 2025 - 9:15 AM)
[x] **IMPLEMENTED: Google Sheets-style merge cells button with separate icon and dropdown**
  - **User Request**: Match Google Sheets merge button exactly - icon and dropdown should be separate
  - **Changes Made**:
    - ✅ Changed icon from Layers to Table2 (grid/table icon matching Google Sheets)
    - ✅ Split into TWO separate buttons visually grouped together:
      - **Main Icon Button** (Table2): Directly merges/unmerges cells (no dropdown)
      - **Dropdown Button** (ChevronDown): Opens menu to select merge type
    - ✅ Icon button intelligently toggles between merge/unmerge based on selection state
    - ✅ Dropdown menu shows all merge type options (all/vertical/horizontal/unmerge)
  
  - **Technical Implementation**:
    - ✅ Updated `GoogleSheetsToolbar.tsx`:
      - Imported Table2 and SlidersHorizontal icons (replaced Layers)
      - Added `isMergedCell` prop to track merge state
      - Created flex container with two buttons (rounded edges for visual grouping)
      - Main button has `rounded-r-none`, dropdown has `rounded-l-none` with border separator
    - ✅ Updated `client/src/pages/home.tsx`:
      - Passed `isMergedCell` prop to GoogleSheetsToolbar
      - isMergedCell already tracked: `selectedCells.length === 1 && mergedCells.some(m => m.startAddress === selectedCells[0])`
    
  - **How It Works Now**:
    1. Click main icon (Table2) → Directly merges (if not merged) or unmerges (if merged)
    2. Click dropdown (ChevronDown) → Opens menu to select merge type (all/vertical/horizontal/unmerge)
    3. Icon and dropdown are separate but visually grouped as one unit
  
  - **Verified Working**:
    - ✅ Application restarted successfully
    - ✅ Screenshot confirms Google Sheets-style button with correct icon
    - ✅ Two separate buttons visually grouped together
    - ✅ No LSP errors
    - ✅ All features working correctly

  - **Root Cause**: Dropdown width was too narrow (w-12 = 48px)
  - **Solution**: 
    - ✅ Increased width from `w-12` to `w-16` (64px)
    - ✅ Added proper padding `px-2` for better spacing
  
  - **Updated Files**:
    - ✅ `client/src/components/GoogleSheetsToolbar.tsx` - Line 293
  
  - **Verified Working**:
    - ✅ Font size "10" now displays completely (no cutting)
    - ✅ Application hot-reloaded successfully

## Merge Cells Google Sheets Style (Oct 12, 2025 - 8:45 AM)

      3. **Merge horizontally** - Merges only in horizontal direction (same row)
      4. **Unmerge** - Unmerges selected merged cell
    
  - **Technical Changes**:
    - ✅ Added DropdownMenu component from shadcn/ui
    - ✅ Updated `handleMergeCells()` to accept merge type parameter
    - ✅ Implemented merge logic for all/vertical/horizontal types

## Default Font Size Optimization (Oct 11, 2025 - 6:10 PM)
[x] **OPTIMIZED: Default font size adjusted for default cell dimensions**
  - **Problem 1**: 11px font size was too small for default 64px × 20px cells
  - **Problem 2**: Font size was not displaying in toolbar
  - **Solution**: Changed default font size from 11px to 13px across all components
  - **Updated files:**
    - ✅ `client/src/components/SpreadsheetCell.tsx` - Updated default fontSize parameter
    - ✅ `client/src/pages/home.tsx` - Updated all default fontSize references (3 locations)
    - ✅ `client/src/components/SpreadsheetGrid.tsx` - Updated default fontSize for empty cells

  - **Technical details:**
    - Old default: 11px (Excel standard)
    - New default: 13px (Optimized for default 64px × 20px cells)
    - **Clarification**: Default cell size is 64px × 20px (width × height)
    - **Note**: 32px is the MINIMUM limit for cells, not the default
    - All existing cells retain their custom font sizes
    - Only affects new/unformatted cells

    - ✅ `client/src/components/ExcelFontControls.tsx` - Arial first in dropdown, default 10px
  
  - **Google Sheets Research Findings**:
    - Default: 100px width × 21px height, Arial 10pt
    - Manual resize is remembered (no auto-revert)
    - Font size changes DON'T auto-adjust column width
    - Text wrapping auto-adjusts row height
    - Text overflow: spills into adjacent empty cells or truncates
    - Double-click border: auto-fits to content (not yet implemented)
  
  - **Technical Details**:
    - Column width: min 100px, max 300px (increased from 150px)
    - Row height: min 21px, max 300px
