## Summary
✅ All packages installed successfully (478 packages)
✅ Workflow "Start application" is running on port 5000
✅ Application verified and working - StyleSheet (Excel-like Builder) app is fully functional
✅ Select button bug fixed and verified
✅ Temporary selection (5-second) workflow fixed - drag selections now stay for 5 seconds allowing multiple style changes

## Current Workflow
1. **Drag Selection**: Creates temporary selection (5 seconds)

3. **Lock Button**: Directly converts temporary → permanent AND enables lock mode (or toggles if already permanent)
4. **Apply Changes**: Selection clears after one change (if Lock OFF)
5. **Double-click Header/Grid**: Deselects all cells instantly

## Latest Fixes
✅ Lock button now works directly - no need to click Select first! It automatically converts temporary selections to permanent and enables lock mode in one click.

✅ **Font display issue PROPERLY FIXED** - Selection now stays active after changing font/size, so toolbar always shows the current font of selected cells
  - Changed all font formatting handlers to preserve selection instead of clearing it
  - When cells are selected and you change font, selection stays so you can see the current values
  - Temporary selections automatically convert to permanent when formatting is applied
✅ **Double-click selection border removed** - Added select-none CSS to toolbar controls (buttons, labels) while keeping text selection enabled in Input field

## Updated Workflow for Fonts
